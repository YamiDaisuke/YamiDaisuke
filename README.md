### Welcome!!! 🤓 

### About Me 🇸🇻 🇨🇱

Hi, my name is Franklin Cruz, I'm a developer I love coding and most of all learn new things, this is my personal GitHub 
account where I work on my side projects aimed to learn and practice new technologies, while also having fun 😉.

I'm mostly specialized in iOS Development, but life has taken me into the path of backend, Android, and a little Web development. 
Currently, I work as a platform architecture at [FZSports](https://fzsports.com) for [Nunchee](https://nunchee.com) and 
[Fanatiz](https://watch.fanatiz.com).

Here are some stats about what I've doing here! 🔬

### My Current Projects 🧑🏾‍💻

#### [Hermes Swift:](https://github.com/YamiDaisuke/hermes-swift) 🍎

A compiler and interpreter written in swift! based on these great books:
  - [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com)
  - [Writing A Compiler In Go](https://compilerbook.com)

#### [My Personal Blog:](https://github.com/YamiDaisuke/yamidaisuke.github.io) 🕸️

I started building this to practice my web development skills that are a bit rusty

#### [TODO All:](https://github.com/YamiDaisuke/todoall) 📱

Yeah, I know this is a little cliche but I'm using this project to practice and get familiar with Swift UI 
and other new frameworks for iOS development. The idea is to build a fully functional TODO app closer 
to what you'll find in apps like **"Todoist"** than the typical tutorial app.
